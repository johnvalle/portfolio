## The Challenge

```ts
type Result = Unshift<[1, 2], 0>; // [0, 1, 2]
```

Implement the type version ofÂ `Array.unshift`

<!-- truncate -->

## The Solution

```ts
type Unshift<T extends unknown[], U> = [U, ...T];
```

## Step 1: Understanding Generics

```ts
<T extends unknown[], U>
```

We're expecting two incoming types:

- `T extends unknown[]`: An array containing any type
- `U`: The type that we want to insert into `T`.

## Step 2: New Type

```ts
[U, ...T];
```

The incoming `T` type can be spread as the first element but since we're trying to implement `Array.unshift`,
it's important to note that the new item should be at the first element of the list.
This is why we put `U` first then spread type `T`.

Implementing it other way around should be `Array.push`.
