title: TS Challenge Day 4 - Tuple to Object

## The Challenge

```ts
const tuple = ["tesla", "model 3", "model X", "model Y"] as const;

type result = TupleToObject<typeof tuple>; // expected { 'tesla': 'tesla', 'model 3': 'model 3', 'model X': 'model X', 'model Y': 'model Y'}
```

> Given an array, transform it into an object type and the key/value must be in the provided array.

<!-- truncate -->

## The Solution

```ts
type TupleToObject<T extends readonly (string | number | symbol)[]> =
  T[number] extends string | number | symbol
    ? { [Key in T[number]]: Key }
    : never;
```

## Step 1: Understanding Generics

```ts
type TupleToObject<T extends readonly (string | number | symbol)[]>
```

The generic looks lengthy but it's nothing to worry! We're just telling our type that we are limiting `T` to only be a readonly list of `string`, `number`, or `symbol` because it's a tuple.

## Step 2: Indexed Access Types

```ts
{ [Key in T[number]]: Key }

// Array: ["dog", 1]
// Result: { "dog": "dog", 1: 1 }
```

The type above closely resembles creating an exact copy of an object type similar to [Day 2](./2024-10-01-nthdayts-2.md) and [Day 3](./2024-10-02-nthdayts-3.md) challenge. However, you might notice that we're not using the `keyof` operator.

This is because we are looping over a tuple and we are accessing the elements in `T` using `[number]`. This element, which can be a `string`, `number`, or `symbol` is used as a key and a value for the object.

## Step 3: Conditional Types

```ts
T[number] extends string | number | symbol
    ? { [Key in T[number]]: Key }
    : never;
```

After constructing the object, we then just setup or condition to check that if the element in the array `T[number]` is `string`, `number`, or `symbol` then we return our constructed object type. Otherwise, we don't return anything.
