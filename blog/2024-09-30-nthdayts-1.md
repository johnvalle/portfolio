Today marks the first day of solving Typescript challenges. The goal is to solve all 13 Typescript challenges from the [Online Type Challenge](https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges) collection as a way to explore advanced TypeScript concepts. However, it's not simply solving all these challenges by showing the problem and the solution. The goal is also to explain the solution to a challenge in an ELI-5 (explain like i'm five) kind of way.

<!-- truncate -->

On an initial look, these 13 challenges might be labeled "easy" but they could get challenging as some challenges are not usually encountered in a day-to-day scenario. So formally start off, forr day 1, here's the first challenge.

Challenge:

```ts
// you should make this work
type test = Expect<Equal<HelloWorld, string>>;
```

Solution:

```ts
type HelloWorld = string;
```
