## The Challenge

```ts
type ExampleType = Promise<string>;

type Result = MyAwaited<ExampleType>; // string
```

If we have a type which is a wrapped type like Promise, how we can get the type which is inside the wrapped type?

> For example: if we have Promise<ExampleType> how to get ExampleType?

<!-- truncate -->

## The Solution

```ts
type MyAwaited<T> = T extends Promise<infer K>
  ? K extends Promise<unknown>
    ? MyAwaited<K>
    : K
  : never;
```

## Step 1: Conditional Types: 1st Condition

```ts
T extends Promise<infer K> ? K extends Promise<unknown> ? MyAwaited<K> : K : never
```

We have two conditional types in our generic and we see our own generic being called as a recursive type. To simply understand this, we can convert it to a regular `if/else` statement.

```ts
if (T extends Promise<infer K>) {
  if (K extends Promise<unknown>) {
    return MyAwaited<K>
  } else {
    return K
  }
} else {
  return never;
}
```

We're inferring the value inside `Promise` as `K` and if the statement is true, we then check if the inferred value. Otherwise, we don't return anything.

## Step 2: Conditional Types: 2nd Condition

```ts
if (K extends Promise<unknown>) {
  return MyAwaited<K>
} else {
  return K
}
```

Normally, we can just return the value of inferred type such as in the `else` statement but we also want to check to for cases when our generic receives another promise such as:

```ts
MyAwaited < Promise<Promise<string>>;
```

In this case, we can call our generic recursively and pass our inferred type as the argument, hence the 2nd condition.

```ts
K extends Promise<unknown> ? MyAwaited<K> : K
```

## Step 3: PromiseLike

The solution is already enough for most cases.

```ts
type MyAwaited<T> = T extends Promise<infer K>
  ? K extends Promise<unknown>
    ? MyAwaited<K>
    : K
  : never;
```

However, this criteria also needs to pass.

```ts
type T = { then: (onfulfilled: (arg: number) => any) => any };
```

Using our solution for this type will fail but you might wonder why it would. It looks like a promise, works like a promise, but it isn't exactly a promise.

Which reminds me, there's two of these "ducktypes" in TS I could personally recall: (1) `ArrayLike` and (2) `PromiseLike`. So to pass this criteria, we can then replace `Promise` with `PromiseLike`.

```ts
type MyAwaited<T> = T extends PromiseLike<infer K>
  ? K extends PromiseLike<unknown>
    ? MyAwaited<K>
    : K
  : never;
```

So in my most cases, this generic should unwrap deeply nested Promises or Promise-like types.
