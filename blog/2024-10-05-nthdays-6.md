title: TS Challenge Day 6 - Length of Tuple
tags: [ts-challenge]
---

## The Challenge

```ts
type tesla = ["tesla", "model 3", "model X", "model Y"];
type spaceX = [
  "FALCON 9",
  "FALCON HEAVY",
  "DRAGON",
  "STARSHIP",
  "HUMAN SPACEFLIGHT"
];

type teslaLength = Length<tesla>; // expected 4
type spaceXLength = Length<spaceX>; // expected 5
```

> For given a tuple, you need create a genericÂ `Length`, pick the length of the tuple

<!-- truncate -->

## The Solution

```ts
type Length<T extends readonly unknown[]> = T["length"];
```

## Step 1: Understanding Generics

```ts
type Length<T extends readonly unknown[]>
```

We're telling our generic to expect a tuple.

## Step 2: Accessing Methods

```ts
T["length"];
```

We know our `T` is an array and with TypeScript, aside from accessing elements, we can also access these primitive types' methods. We can then access the `length` method to get length of the array.
