## The Challenge

```ts
type Result = MyExclude<"a" | "b" | "c", "a">; // 'b' | 'c'
```

To conclude our first week, we're going to build the `Exclude` Utility type from scratch.

> Exclude from `T` those types that are assignable to `U

<!-- truncate -->

## The Solution

```ts
type MyExclude<T, U> = T extends U ? never : T;
```

## Step 1: Understanding Generics

```ts
type MyExclude<T, U>
```

For our generic, we're expecting type `T` and `U` which could both be a union type.

## Step 2: Conditional Types

```ts
T extends U ? never : T;
```

We then check if `T` extends `U`. If it does, we don't return the type as the exclusion logic. Otherwise, we return the type if it's not indicated in type `U`. That's it! We've created the `Exclude` generic from scratch.
