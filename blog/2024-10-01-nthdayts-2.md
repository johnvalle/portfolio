## The Challenge

```ts
interface Todo {
  title: string;
  description: string;
  completed: boolean;
}

type TodoPreview = MyPick<Todo, "title" | "completed">;

const todo: TodoPreview = {
  title: "Clean room",
  completed: false,
};
```

For Day 2 of the TS Challenge - We're gonna implement the `Pick` utility type from scratch.

> Implement the built-in `Pick<T, K>` generic without using it.
> Constructs a type by picking the set of properties `K` from `T`
> For example:

## The Solution

```ts
type MyPick<T, K extends keyof T> = [K] extends [keyof T]
  ? { [Key in K]: T[Key] }
  : never;
```

## Step 1: Understanding Generics

```ts
type MyPick<T, K extends keyof T>
```

In this line, `T` represents the original object (like our Todo), and K is a subset of keys from `T`. But there’s a restriction: K must be one of the keys in T. This is what `K extends keyof T` means—it’s like saying, “K must be a key from the `Todo` object.”

## Step 2: Mapped Types & Indexed Access

```ts
{ [Key in K]: T[Key] }
```

This line looks complex, but it’s actually doing something simple. We’re constructing a new object by looping through each key in K (using Key in K) and assigning the value from T to it. Think of this as creating a new object by picking only specific properties:

- `Key in K`: We're going through all the keys in K (like 'title' or 'completed').
- `T[Key]`: This is how we grab the value of that key from T.

## Step 3: Conditional Types

```ts
[K] extends [keyof T] ? { [Key in K]: T[Key] } : never;
```

We add a conditional check here to make sure that K is a valid key of T. If it is, we return our new object type. Otherwise, we return never, which is TypeScript’s way of saying, “this type is not allowed.”

## Step 4: The Magic of Brackets

Normally, conditional types in TypeScript are distributed. This means they’ll evaluate each key individually, potentially creating a union of objects. But we don’t want that—we want one combined object with all the picked properties. That’s where the brackets `[K]` come in. They tell TypeScript to treat K as a single set, not as separate values.

For example:

```ts
type MyPickResult = MyPick<
  { name: string; age: number; city: string },
  "name" | "city"
>;
// Result: { name: string; city: string }
```

Without the brackets, the result would be a union of `{ name: string } | { city: string }`, which is not what we want.
