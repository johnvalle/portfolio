title: TS Challenge Day 5 - First of Array

## The Challenge

```ts
type arr1 = ["a", "b", "c"];
type arr2 = [3, 2, 1];

type head1 = First<arr1>; // expected to be 'a'
type head2 = First<arr2>; // expected to be 3
```

> Implement a generic `First<T>` that takes an Array `T` and returns its first element's type.

<!-- truncate -->

## The Solution

```ts
type First<T extends any[]> = T["length"] extends 0 ? never : T[0];
```

## Step 1: Understanding Generics

```ts
type First<T extends any[]>
```

For our generic, we want to restrict incoming types to be an array of any type.

## Step 2: Conditional Types

```ts
T["length"] extends 0 ? never : T[0];
```

We can just simply return `T[0]` to return the first element of an array. However, we also want to consider the case if the incoming array has no items at all. For that case, we want to access the array's `length` method and see if it is empty by checking if it extends `0`.
