## The Challenge

`````ts
type isPillarMen = Includes<["Kars", "Esidisi", "Wamuu", "Santana"], "Dio">; // expected to be `false````
`````

Implement the JavaScript `Array.includes` function in the type system. A type takes the two arguments. The output should be a boolean `true` or `false`.

## The Solution

```ts
// Generic type to check if two types are equal
type Equal<X, Y> = (<T>() => T extends X ? 1 : 2) extends <T>() => T extends Y
  ? 1
  : 2
  ? true
  : false;

type Includes<T extends readonly any[], U> = T extends [
  infer First,
  ...infer Rest
]
  ? Equal<First, U> extends true
    ? true
    : Includes<Rest, U>
  : false;
```

## Step 1: Equal Type

```ts
type Equal<X, Y> = (<T>() => T extends X ? 1 : 2) extends <T>() => T extends Y
  ? 1
  : 2
  ? true
  : false;
```

For the type challenge, a utility type can be used to compare equality between two types. We will be using this utility type later on to compare type existence in a given list.

## Step 2: First Conditional Type

```ts
T extends [infer First, ...infer Rest] ? Equal<First, U> extends true ? ... : ... : false;
```

The generic has two conditional types. The first conditional type essentially creates an array type where
the first and the rest of the element types are inferred. The rest of the elements are retrieved using the spread operator.

```ts
[infer First, ...infer Rest]
```

With the first element inferred, the incoming type `U`, which is the element to be checked in the array,
is compared with the first one using the `Equal` generic we get from the utils of `@type-challenges/utils`.

## Step 3: Second Conditional Type

In the event that the inferred element `First` do not resolve to `true` when comapred with `U`, we call the `Includes` generic recursively but this time, the rest of the elements with type `Rest` is passed in as a type.

```ts
Equal<First, U> extends true ? true : Includes<Rest, U>
```

This approach then checks for the 2nd element and the rest until all the elements are checked for equality with type `U`.
