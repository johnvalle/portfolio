## The Challenge

```ts
interface Todo {
  title: string;
  description: string;
}

const todo: MyReadonly<Todo> = {
  title: "Hey",
  description: "foobar",
};

todo.title = "Hello"; // Error: cannot reassign a readonly property
todo.description = "barFoo"; // Error: cannot reassign a readonly property
```

For Day 3 of the TS Challenge - We're gonna implement a `Readonly` generic that turns objects into to readonly.

> Implement the built-in `Readonly<T>` generic without using it. Constructs a type with all properties of T set to readonly, meaning the properties of the constructed type cannot be reassigned.

<!-- truncate -->

## The Solution

```ts
type MyReadonly<T> = { readonly [Key in keyof T]: T[Key] };
```

## Step 1: Mapped Types & Indexed Access

```ts
{ [Key in keyof T]: T[Key] }
```

The generic is straightforward: We want to have the exact same copy of the incoming type `T` and turn it into readonly. To recreate the object, we create a copy using Indexed Access Type for the key and Mapped Types for the property.

- `[Key in keyof T]`: Going through all the keys of the object in `T`
- `T[Key]`: Accessing the object value using the key.

## Step 2: Turning the object readonly

```ts
type MyReadonly<T> = { readonly [Key in keyof T]: T[Key] };
```

Finally, after recreating the object contents, we just want want to turn them into readonly so we're adding the keyword and that's it. We solved the challenge.
