## The Challenge

```ts
type Result = Push<[1, 2], "3">; // [1, 2, '3']
```

Implement the generic version of Array.push

<!-- truncate -->

## The Solution

```ts
type Push<T extends unknown[], U> = [...T, U];
```

## Step 1: Understanding Generics

```ts
<T extends unknown[], U>
```

We're expecting two incoming types:

- `T extends unknown[]`: An array containing any type
- `U`: The type that we want to insert into `T`.

## Step 2: New Type

```ts
[...T, U];
```

Similar to how we combine two arrays using the spread operator,
we can also create a new list by using the spread operator for `T` and adding the new element `U`.

And that's it! We have created a push generic!
