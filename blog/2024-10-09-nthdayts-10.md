## The Challenge

```ts
type Result = Concat<[1], [2]>; // expected to be [1, 2]
```

Implement the JavaScript Array.concat function in the type system. A type takes the two arguments. The output should be a new array that includes inputs in ltr order

<!-- truncate -->

## The Solution

```ts
type Concat<T extends readonly unknown[], U extends readonly unknown[]> = [
  ...T,
  ...U
];
```

## Step 1: Understanding Generics

```ts
type Concat<T extends readonly unknown[], U extends readonly unknown[]>
```

Let's tell our generic to expect 2 tuples represented with type `T` and `U`. Because we're not really stricly expecting any specific type, let's leave it unknown.

## Step 2: New Type

```ts
[...T, ...U];
```

Similar to how we would combine two arrays together in JavaScript, we can also use spread operator to combine two arrays to create a new one. With that, we have our concat generic type.
